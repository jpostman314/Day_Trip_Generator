# Day_Trip_Generator
                                        Welcome to the Day Trip Generator!!

The purpose of this program is to randomly select a destination, a restaurant, a mode of transportation, and a form of entertainment. The user will have the ability to accept or decline each randomly chosen selection at the time of their selection. If the user declines the randomly chosen selection, it will be removed from the list of choices and a different one will be selected for their approval. Once the user accepts all 4 catergories, they will be listed out and again the user wil be asked if these choices are acceptable for them. If the user accpets their choices, they will be displayed in a sentence telling them where they will be going, where they will be eating, how they will get there and what their entertainment will be. If the user declines their choices, the program will ask each question again to ensure the user gets their desired day trip itinerary.

I hope you enjoy the program!!
